## Writing Pages

Create your `*.twig` in `entries` folder.

The template file path will matches the url path.
If you go `path/to/your/page`, Vaseman will render `entries/path/to/your/page.twig` for you.

## Base URI

Using `{{ uri.base }}` to add subfolder for assets url.

For Example, If you are in a page `foo/bar/baz.html`, You can use this url as link href:

``` twig
<a href="{{ uri.base }}sakura.html">Link</a>
```

The link will render as:

``` html
<a href="../../sakura.html">Link</a>
```

So the page link will not break in every pages.
